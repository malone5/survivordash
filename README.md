<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After going on a wild binge of Survivors seasons I was curious about the data an some insights that could
be derrived from it. So I looked into some survivor data sources and found an opportunity to sharpen my data engineering skills
and learn more about the seasons I thoughouly enjoyed.

Going into this project I have always dreaded non-portable and/or complicated development environments and
wanted to get my first exposure with Docker and ultimatly create a basic data ecosystem that could be portable and 
setup with minimal commands for anyone interested in using it.

Things I wanted to accomplish:
* Fetch and model multiple sources of survivor season data (Python)
* load it inot a warehouse-like environment (Postgres)
* explore the data in a BI-tool (Metabase)
* Create a workflow to quickly develop and manage environments (Docker)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* Docker


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/malone5/survivordash.git
   cd survivordash
   ```
2. Create an ```.env``` file in the home directory. 
    ```sh
    touch env
    ```
    ```sh
   POSTGRES_USER=<user>
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pass>
   POSTGRES_DB=warehouse
   POSTGRES_HOST=db
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   MB_DB_DBNAME=metabase
   MB_EMAIL=dev@local.host
   MB_PASS=fakepass1
    ```
3. Start the continers
   ```sh
   make up
   ```

4. Run the pipeline (Make sure Metabase(localhost:4000) has completed installation)
   ```sh
   docker exec -it pipeline python /code/src/survivordash/run.py
   ```

5. Visit
   ```sh
   http://localhost:3000  [Metabase BI Tool]
   http://localhost:4000  [Postgres Adminer]
   ```
   MB_EMAIL and MB_PASS is what you will use to log into the metabase BI tool
